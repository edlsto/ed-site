The two types `null` and `undefined` seem similar. They're both a kind of nothing â€” falsy values they aren't a number or string.

But what is the difference between these two types of values?

The official spec of JavaScript, called the Ecma Standard, [says this about null](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/11.0/index.html#sec-ecmascript-language-types-null-type):

"The Null type has exactly one value, called null."

OK, so the `Null` type can only have a value of null. But what does that value represent? [MDN says](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/null) it represents "the intentional absence of any object value."

APIs can return `null` where an object is expected, but no object meets the criteria provided to the API.

As for `undefined`, [the spec says](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/11.0/index.html#sec-ecmascript-language-types-undefined-type) this:

"The Undefined type has exactly one value, called undefined. Any variable that has not been assigned a value has the value undefined."

So when a variable is declared but not yet assigned a value, it automatically has a value of `undefined`.

Also, when a function does not return a value, it returns `undefined`.

```jsx
// a variable is declared, but not assigned a value
var foo
console.log(foo)
// undefined

foo === undefined
// true

!!foo
// false
```

```jsx
// a function does not return a value
function bar() {
  1 + 2
}
console.log(bar())
// undefined
```

`Undefined` and `null` are among JavaScript's seven primitive types. (Remember, a primitive type is a value that is not an object and has no methods. Also, primitive values are immutable.) Those seven types are:

- String
- Number
- Bigint
- Boolean
- Symbol
- Undefined
- Null

But wait! MDN actually says there are six primitives, which excludes `null`. It calls `null` a "special case." The `typeof` operator shows that null is, in fact, an object:

```jsx
typeof null

// "object"
```

[This post by Dr. Axel Rauschmayer](https://2ality.com/2013/10/typeof-null.html) shows that this is actually a bug from the first version of JavaScript that has never been fixed.

In that version, types were denoted by a type tag as well as the actual data of the value. `null` was represented by the NULL pointer, which is `0x00`. In that case, `0` is the type tag, which is the type tag of an object.

However, [MDN also notes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Null) that every Object is derived from the `null` value, so it makes sense that `null` is defined as an object.

"Every Object is derived from null value, and therefore typeof operator returns object for it."

To sum it up, `null` is the intentional absence of value. `undefined` is a value for something that does not exist yet or does not exist anymore.
